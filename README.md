#RubyAutomation
Independent Automation Project - Summer 2016

Starting in June 2016 until September 2016, I worked with a mentor from Spigit's former QA Automation team to learn the  basics of Quality Assurance, manual testing, and automation for the purpose of testing. All features included in RubyAutomation and RubyAutomation2 repositories are for practice on automating taks such as performing searches across multiple engines, searching for flights/hotels/cars online, and logging in to multiple websites with provided credentials. 

Automation framework for Spigit used as base code - may be some residual lines of code left from there.

All features written using Cucumber for organization. Step definitions and all classes written in Ruby. 

Some pages needed for complete execution not included (specifically, User and Payment classes) b/c contain sensitive information
