Feature: AmexTravel Flight Booking

  Scenario Outline:
    Given I navigate to the external "<booking>" site
    When I click on the "<type of flight>" button
    And I fill in the "departure" field with "<starting point>" value
    #I made the one below and then used an existing function!
    Then I select "<airport>" option from the "first" dropdown menu
    And I fill in the "arrival" field with "<ending point>" value
    Then I select "<airport2>" option from the "second" dropdown menu
    Then I click on the "departure date" button
    And I select a date from the datepicker on the "<DepDate>" section
    Then  I select "<time>" option from the "dept time" dropdown menu
    And I click on the "return date" button
    Then I select a date from the datepicker on the "<RetDate>" section
    And I select "<time2>" option from the "ret time" dropdown menu
    #FINISH BELOW#
    #Question: If children are on board, there appear boxes based on how many there are.
    #What would be a good place to specify their ages since we don't know beforehand how many kids there are
    Then I click on the "number of travelers" button with "<seniors>", "<adults>", and "<children>"
    Then I click on the "nonstop flight" button
    And I select "<class type>" option from the "fare class" dropdown menu
    Then I click on the "search flights" button
    #So right now, the only way it'll fail is if the website messes up, b/c then it won't find the correct xpath. But is there another way to induce failure or to assert that it's not working?
    Then I verify that flight info from "<airport>" to "<airport2>" with "<seniors>", "<adults>", and "<children>" in "<class type>" is displayed
